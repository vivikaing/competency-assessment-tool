# Competency Assessment Tool

This is a tool to visualise the assessment of competencies for responsible public value creation. It uses a sunburst diagram to visualise the results of the assessment of each of the competencies.

The dataset includes assessment data from the case studies illustrating the tool's use, as published in this journal: Sustainable urban digital innovation: A socio-technical competency-based approach to evaluation (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2024.105946).
